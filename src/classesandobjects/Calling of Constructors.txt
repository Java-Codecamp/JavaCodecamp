1. A constructor has the same name as the name of the class and no return type.
Constructor of class A will be 
A()
maybe 
public A()
public void/int A() is not a constructor
2. If no class constructor is defined then Java provides a default constructor
which does nothing and has no parameters. Automatic constructor is not provided
if programmer makes a constructor
3. Constructor is always called when an object is created
4. In inheritance constructor of all the super classes is called first ending
at the java.lang.Object class
5. The super class must have a default constructor or the sub class must call
the super class constructor using super
6. Call to super must be the 1st statement of the sub class constructor
7. Java allows multiple constructors with object blocks for common statements
